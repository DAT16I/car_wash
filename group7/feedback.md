# General

Great method comments! Top dollar.
Good thinking naming the files the same as the user.
Nice usage of switch case statements. Very appropriate.

It's hard to find anything to bash since you have good naming, good separation
of concerns, show that you can do OOP and has a decent flow.

## WashUser.java
Watch out for having too much logic in the constructor. Separate it up a bit in
the future. I see why you do it here and can appreciate that!
