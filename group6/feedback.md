# General

I love seeing all of these features implemented. That's pretty cool.
Great to see comments!
Good with the READ ME.txt.

If there is one thing I would say it is that the main logic file is quite big
and if you would add new functionality it would just grow bigger and bigger.
Try and separate the flow a bit as well.

Honestly i do not have much to say other than great job.
