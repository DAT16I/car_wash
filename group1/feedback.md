# General

`Simple` what? SimpleWash? SimpleCar? SimpleCustomer? Be more specific.
I like the inheritance from Simple -> Wax -> Premium  but maybe put a bit more
of the logic inside of the classes instead of them just being dumb containers
for data.

It works and it kinda full-fills the requirements, but it's not pretty and it's
not sustainable for further development.

## WashProject.java

```java
//
// Source code recreated from a .class file by IntelliJ IDEA
// (powered by Fernflower decompiler)
//
```

Whats's up with this? What happened? What's the story?

It's also a lot of logic in  single file. Don't you think you could have
separated and scoped it a bit differently? What if you need more functionality?
Keep on expanding this single file?
